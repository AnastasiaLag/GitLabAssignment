I worked on my own, so i did all the given tasks!

I didn't have any issues with the tasks, and I did a very nice refresh
of the git basics

Fun fact? I have just started my intern atship at a company that uses git and I am enrolled in a udemy-course git mastery and I refrsh git basics twice in this easter week!

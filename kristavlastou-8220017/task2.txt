My partener for this task was EvaNtziou and 
I implemented : 2, 4, 6
Eva implemented: 1, 3, 5

Before the tutorial, I only knew the basics of Git, like how to add, commit, and push changes.
The tutorial really helped me understand more advanced features and workflows.
What I found most useful was learning how to manage the commit history properly,
because in the past I almost embarrassed myself several times with messy commit logs.

So I really couldn't think of something really intresting to write about me although
I believe I am an intresting person (I hope at least) but one time one time, 
I missed my trip from Thessaloniki to Athens because I spent two hours waiting 
in line to buy four kilos of Trigona Panoramatos.

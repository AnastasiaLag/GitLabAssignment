In this directory you will find the files needed to complete task2. 
stockmarket.py is a simple web app built with Streamlit (Go team Git Commit Fraud) that allows a user to click on a company's logo and see a chart for its stock's price.  
You're tasked with improving the app by implementing the 6 features described in the beginning of the file.  
There are 2 features labeled #E for easy and 4 labeled #H for hard so you should split them evenly between the two of you.  

Before starting you should run 'pip install requirements.txt' in your terminal to install all the dependencies needed for the app to run.  
Another command you'll be using a lot is streamlit run 'path/to/stockmarket.py' to actually run the app.
